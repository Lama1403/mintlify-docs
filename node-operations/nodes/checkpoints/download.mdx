# Download Checkpoints

Use the following links to download checkpoint files for different Zilliqa 2.0 networks.

## Devnet Checkpoints

Visit the checkpoint repository for Devnet:
- **Checkpoint URL**: https://checkpoints.zq2-devnet.zilliqa.com
- **API Endpoint**: https://api.zq2-devnet.zilliqa.com

<Note>
Browse the XML listing to find the latest checkpoint files. Look for the topmost `<key>` tag which contains the most recent checkpoint file name in `block_num.dat` format.
</Note>

## Testnet Checkpoints

Visit the checkpoint repository for Testnet:
- **Checkpoint URL**: https://checkpoints.testnet.zilliqa.com  
- **API Endpoint**: https://api.zq2-testnet.zilliqa.com

<Note>
Download the latest checkpoint file for faster synchronization. Historical checkpoints are available in the `previous/` directory.

## Mainnet Checkpoints

Visit the checkpoint repository for Mainnet:
- **Checkpoint URL**: https://checkpoints.zilliqa.com
- **API Endpoint**: https://api.zq2-mainnet.zilliqa.com

<Warning>
Always verify the block hash when configuring checkpoints in your node configuration file. Use the corresponding API endpoint to retrieve the block hash for validation.
</Warning>

## How to Use

1. Visit the appropriate checkpoint URL for your target network
2. Find the latest checkpoint file (topmost `<key>` tag in the XML listing)
3. Download the checkpoint file using `wget` or your browser:
   ```bash
   wget https://checkpoints.<network>.zilliqa.com/<block_num.dat>
   ```
4. Configure the checkpoint in your node configuration file
5. Start your node following the [checkpoint setup guide](/node-operations/nodes/checkpoints)

<Info>
Checkpoints are generated every 86400 blocks and provide a validated state from which nodes can begin synchronization, significantly reducing startup time compared to syncing from genesis.
